Compare two powerpoint presentations. 

This is a very small project, used to compare two .pptx files and see if they are similar. 


## A few notes:
#### To be compared, images are converted into binary strings
#### Files that need to be compares have to be in the same folder as the script and be names "original.pptx" and "new.pptx"
#### This has not been thoroughly tested and made to help a family member
