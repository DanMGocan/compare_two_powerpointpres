# Compare two powerpoint presentations
#### This is a very small project, used to compare two .pptx files and see if they are similar. It compares text and images.

## A few notes:
- To be compared, images are converted into binary strings that occupy more space and consume more resources when being processed
- Files that need to be compared have to be in the same folder as the script and be names **"original.pptx"** and **"new.pptx"**
- Results are written in a new .txt document, in the same folder
- This has not been thoroughly tested
